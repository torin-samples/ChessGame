| 2/11/24  | Learned how to create an application using react. Setup the folder for the client side of the application. Added necessary modules and dependencies (With the exception of @mui/material) |
| 2/15/24  | Changed folder name from chess to client because that is what the folder is going to contain. Understood that react has a react-chessboard which contains the board/piece movement functionality and JS had a chess.js library containing all the chess logic. Imported the library and component, setup temporary code from this blog: https://blog.openreplay.com/building-a-chess-game-with-react/ in the Game.js file. Added a public folder with index.html so that we could run the application and test basic piece movement functionality from the react component. We came to the decision of using the component and library to implement chess using react and coming back to it in the future to attempt writing our own code for the chess board/pieces and logic of the game.|
